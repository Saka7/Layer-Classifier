And\r\n``` Bash\r\n java -jar build/libs/Layer-Classifier[version].jar\r\n```\r\nTo run it.\r\n\r\n## Main Window\r\nMain window contains two tables with real and training data, selectbox with neural net types and text area for results logging.\r\nTo start training you should first fill training data table.\r\n\r\n![Main Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saka7/Layer-Classifier/master/screenshots/main-window.png)\r\n\r\n## Training Settings\r\nWhen you click on train button - training settings popup menu shows up. In this menu you can customize learning speed, max iterations and max available error of neural net.\r\n\r\n![Training Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saka7/Layer-Classifier/master/screenshots/training-settings.png)\r\n\r\n## Error decreasing Graphs\r\nAfter training, error decreasing chart shows up. This chart represent value of error on each iteration.\r\n\r\n![Charts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saka7/Layer-Classifier/master/screenshots/charts.png)\r\n\r\n## Artificial Value Generation\r\nYou can write real data by hand or generate artificial values to test neural net. To generate artificial values just click on generate button and then write amount of rows which should be generated.\r\n\r\n![AVG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saka7/Layer-Classifier/master/screenshots/avg.png)\r\n\r\n## Classifying\r\nWhen you press solve button neural net classifies layers on tire or collector (Don't forget to train neural net before run classification).\r\n\r\n![Classifying](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saka7/Layer-Classifier/master/screenshots/classifying.png)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nLayer-Classifier is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n",
